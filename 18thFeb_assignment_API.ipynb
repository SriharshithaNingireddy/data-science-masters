    "An application programming interface is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    for suppose if i want to transfer money  using GPay internally it has to connect with banking system and check wheather there is suffecient balance in my account or not and afer checking it will transfer to the payee, so here API is used b/w Gpay and bank connectivity    \n",

    "Project and Team Management. Tools like Jira, Basecamp, and Microsoft Teams provide communication between coworkers and data sharing functionality — and that all happens through API.\n",
    "Online Payment Systems. Where digital money transfers occur, there is an API supporting the process. Many organizations choose to utilize APIs from a firm such as PayPal to provide secure, safe money transfers to their customers."

    "An application is said to be RESTful if it follows 6 architectural guidelines. A RESTful application must have:\n",
    "\n",
    "A client-server architecture composed of clients, servers, and resources.\n",
    "Stateless client-server communication, meaning no client content is stored on the server between requests. Information about the session’s state is instead held with the client.\n",
    "Cacheable data to eliminate the need for some client-server interactions.\n",
    "A uniform interface between components so that information is transferred in a standardized form instead of specific to an application’s needs. This is described by Roy Fielding, the originator of REST, as “the central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style from other network-based styles.”\n",
    "A layered system constraint, where client-server interactions can be mediated by hierarchical layers.\n",
    "Code on demand, allowing servers to extend the functionality of a client by transferring executable code (though also reducing visibility, making this an optional guideline).\n",

    " A SOAP message is, in fact, an ordinary XML file that consists of the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Envelope (required): This is the starting and ending tags of the message.\n",
    "Header (optional): It contains the optional attributes of the message. It allows you to extend a SOAP message in a modular and decentralized way.\n",
    "Body (required): It contains the XML data that the server transmits to the receiver.\n",
    "Fault (optional): It carries information about errors occurring during processing the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "shortcomings of SOAP:-\n",
    "As SOAP can only transfer messages as XML files, your SOAP API will be less performant, as XML is a verbose format compared to JSON. API calls made to your server will need more bandwidth and it will take more time to process the request and transfer the response back to the client."
