    "\n",
    "1)It doesn’t block the user. This is because threads are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Better use of system resources is possible since threads execute tasks parallely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Enhanced performance on multi-processor machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Multi-threaded servers and interactive GUIs use multithreading exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)As number of threads increase, complexity increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Synchronization of shared resources (objects, data) is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)It is difficult to debug, result is sometimes unpredictable.\n",

    "\n",
